              <h1>Background</h1>

            <p class="lead">We know that there is a huge amount of research which happens which is
              relevant to the goals of the OpenWorm project, but is not in an immediately usable/compatible format.
              Many researchers/labs may wish to contribute to the project, but the day to day work of
              experiments/analysis/publishing take priority.</p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>OpenWorm Studentships</strong> are a new way to incentivize contribution
              to the project, offering small stipends and recognition to junior researchers who want to spend time bringing their research into the
              OpenWorm project and making it more accessible for the wider community.</p>

            <p class="lead">Anyone involved in <i>C. elegans</i> research who has (or whose lab has) produced data,
              models or software, which has been publicly released and which would be useful for the OpenWorm project.</p>

            <p class="lead">While it's not absolutely necessary that the recipient was personally involved in generating the data, there should be
              some connection to those who produced the data, to ensure that any questions about the data, any clarifying queries are
              quickly answered during the period of the project. For this reason a PhD student/postdoc in the lab which published the data
              would be an ideal candidate for this project.</p>

            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>What is required?</h1>
            </div>

            <p class="lead">The proposed work should focus on translating existing research outputs to an open format, and integrating with OpenWorm’s
              resources/repositories/documentation. It is assumed that the model/application/dataset will already be published
              (even in preprint form), and the time will be spent in making this as accessible/reusable as possible.</p>

              <br>1) The scientific significance of the original work
              <br>2) How well the plans align with the aims of the OpenWorm project
